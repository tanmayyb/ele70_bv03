        <description>The total resources are much less than the zones peak demand.Â The interconnections with QuÃ©bec consist of two 115 kV circuits and five 230 kV circuits. Two of the 230 kV circuits connect Ontario and QuÃ©bec via bidirectional back-to-back HVDC converters located at Outaouais in QuÃ©bec.</description>
